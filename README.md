# How to use it
Download latest Visual Studio and install WindowsForms package
Open the project solution via VisualStudio and start messing around

# Core Features
- Upload .txt mapping file and the app generates visually where the coordinates are located and draw lines to which cities it is connected.
- Algorythm automatically calculates the distances between cities to create "weight", so the A* can determine the distance from start to finish.
- Can edit the file via app and save it

# Limitations
Due to the project being only created for one task, it was not considered to make it reactive to sceen changes or size.
There is no .exe file to open the application from the get-go and unnecessary actions like installing Visual Studio is needed.
The preview screen of the cities locations is small. 541x500 pixels.
